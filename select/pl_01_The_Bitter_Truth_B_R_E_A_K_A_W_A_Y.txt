It started as love
Love leads us to war
Can I really care enough?
Did you even care at all?
It's not the first, and it won't
be the last
Addict for a dramatic life
Said It's written in my past...
'Cause I've seen that part of
you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere I left to hide
that could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you!
Wherever you are, you break and
you scar
You'll never get the best of me,
you'll never get that far!
As you're breaking down, with no
one around
Think of how you've got this
way, remember who you are!
'Cause I've seen that part of
you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere I left to hide
that could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you!
I've seen that part of you
Where I saw the bitter truth!!!
<♪>
'Cause I've seen that part of
you
Where I found the bitter truth
There's nowhere I left to hide
that could save this life
So I'll say goodbye to you!
